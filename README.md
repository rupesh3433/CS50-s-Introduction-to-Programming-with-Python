# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

Welcome to CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python! This repository contains solutions to various programming challenges presented in the course. Each problem set is outlined below along with a brief explanation of what each program does.

## Problem Set 0

### [Indoor Voice](Problem%20set%200%20Functions%20and%20Variables/Indoor%20Voice/indoor.py)

**Description:** This program converts input text to lowercase while preserving punctuation and whitespace.

**File:** `indoor.py`

This program takes input text and converts it to lowercase, ensuring that any punctuation and whitespace remain unchanged.

### [Playback Speed](Problem%20set%200%20Functions%20and%20Variables/Playback%20Speed/playback.py)

**Description:** This program replaces spaces in input text with three periods, mimicking a slower playback speed.

**File:** `playback.py`

The program replaces spaces in the input text with three periods, creating a visual effect similar to slowing down the playback speed.

### [Making Faces](Problem%20set%200%20Functions%20and%20Variables/Making%20Faces/faces.py)

**Description:** This program converts emoticons in input text to corresponding emojis.

**File:** `faces.py`

The program scans the input text for emoticons like ":)" and ":(" and replaces them with corresponding emojis, such as "üôÇ" and "üôÅ".

### [Einstein](Problem%20set%200%20Functions%20and%20Variables/Einstein/einstein.py)

**Description:** This program calculates the energy equivalent of mass using Einstein's famous formula, E=mc¬≤.

**File:** `einstein.py`

The program prompts the user to input mass (in kilograms) and then calculates the equivalent energy in joules using the formula E=mc¬≤, where 'c' is the speed of light.

### [Tip Calculator](Problem%20set%200%20Functions%20and%20Variables/Tip%20Calculator/tip.py)

**Description:** This program calculates the tip amount based on the meal cost and tip percentage.

**File:** `tip.py`

This program calculates the tip amount for a given meal cost and tip percentage provided by the user.



## Problem Set 1

### [Deep Thought](Problem%20set%201%20Conditionals/Deep%20Thought/deep.py)

**Description:** This program prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting "Yes" if the user inputs "42" or (case-insensitively) "forty-two" or "forty two". Otherwise, it outputs "No".

**File:** `deep.py`

In deep.py, the program asks the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything and responds based on the provided input.

### [Home Federal Savings Bank](Problem%20set%201%20Conditionals/Home%20Federal%20Savings%20Bank/bank.py)

**Description:** This program prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with "hello", it outputs $0. If the greeting starts with an "h" (but not "hello"), it outputs $20. Otherwise, it outputs $100.

**File:** `bank.py`

In bank.py, the program checks the user's greeting and outputs an amount based on whether the greeting starts with "hello", an "h", or anything else.

### [File Extensions](Problem%20set%201%20Conditionals/File%20Extensions/extensions.py)

**Description:** This program prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file‚Äôs media type based on its extension. If the file has an unrecognized or missing extension, it outputs "application/octet-stream".

**File:** `extensions.py`

In extensions.py, the program maps file extensions to their corresponding media types and outputs the appropriate type based on the user's input.

### [Math Interpreter](Problem%20set%201%20Conditionals/Math%20Interpreter/interpreter.py)

**Description:** This program prompts the user for an arithmetic expression formatted as "x y z", with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.

**File:** `interpreter.py`

In interpreter.py, the program interprets simple arithmetic expressions and outputs the result, formatted to one decimal place.

### [Meal Time](Problem%20set%201%20Conditionals/Meal%20Time/meal.py)

**Description:** This program prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it‚Äôs breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. If it‚Äôs not time for a meal, it outputs nothing. Time is input in 24-hour format.

**File:** `meal.py`

In meal.py, the program checks the input time and determines if it falls within breakfast, lunch, or dinner time ranges, outputting the corresponding meal time.
