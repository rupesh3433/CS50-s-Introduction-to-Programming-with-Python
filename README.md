# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

## Problem Set 0

Welcome to CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python Problem Set 0! This repository contains solutions to various programming challenges presented in the course. Each problem set is outlined below along with a brief explanation of what each program does.

### [Indoor Voice](Indoor%20Voice/indoor.py)

**Description:** This program converts input text to lowercase while preserving punctuation and whitespace.

**File:** `indoor.py`

This program takes input text and converts it to lowercase, ensuring that any punctuation and whitespace remain unchanged.

### [Playback Speed](Playback%20Speed/playback.py)

**Description:** This program replaces spaces in input text with three periods, mimicking a slower playback speed.

**File:** `playback.py`

The program replaces spaces in the input text with three periods, creating a visual effect similar to slowing down the playback speed.

### [Making Faces](Making%20Faces/faces.py)

**Description:** This program converts emoticons in input text to corresponding emojis.

**File:** `faces.py`

The program scans the input text for emoticons like ":)" and ":(" and replaces them with corresponding emojis, such as "üôÇ" and "üôÅ".

### [Einstein](Einstein/einstein.py)

**Description:** This program calculates the energy equivalent of mass using Einstein's famous formula, E=mc¬≤.

**File:** `einstein.py`

The program prompts the user to input mass (in kilograms) and then calculates the equivalent energy in joules using the formula E=mc¬≤, where 'c' is the speed of light.

### [Tip Calculator](Tip%20Calculator/tip.py)

**Description:** This program calculates the tip amount based on the meal cost and tip percentage.

**File:** `tip.py`

This program calculates the tip amount for a given meal cost and tip percentage provided by the user.
