### [Math Interpreter](Problem%20set%201%20Conditionals/Math%20Interpreter/interpreter.py)

**Description:** This program prompts the user for an arithmetic expression formatted as "x y z", with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.

**File:** `interpreter.py`

In interpreter.py, the program interprets simple arithmetic expressions and outputs the result, formatted to one decimal place.

### [Meal Time](Problem%20set%201%20Conditionals/Meal%20Time/meal.py)

**Description:** This program prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it‚Äôs breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. If it‚Äôs not time for a meal, it outputs nothing. Time is input in 24-hour format.

**File:** `meal.py`

In meal.py, the program checks the input time and determines if it falls within breakfast, lunch, or dinner time ranges, outputting the corresponding meal time.







## Problem Set 2

### [camelCase](Problem%20set%202%20Loops/Camel%20Case/camel.py)

**Description:** This program converts camel case variable names into snake case.

**File:** `camel.py`

The program prompts the user for a variable name in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. For example, `firstName` becomes `first_name`.

### [Coke Machine](Problem%20set%202%20Loops/Coke%20Machine/coke.py)

**Description:** This program simulates a Coke vending machine, accepting coins and calculating change.

**File:** `coke.py`

The program prompts the user to insert coins (25 cents, 10 cents, or 5 cents) until the total reaches or exceeds 50 cents. It then outputs how much change is owed.

### [Just setting up my twttr](Problem%20set%202%20Loops/Twttr/twttr.py)

- No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.

It outputs "Valid" if all conditions are met, otherwise "Invalid".

### [Nutrition Facts](Problem%20set%202%20Loops/Nutrition%20Facts/nutrition.py)

**Description:** This program outputs the number of calories for a given fruit.

**File:** `nutrition.py`

The program prompts the user to input the name of a fruit (case-insensitively) and outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, based on the FDA's nutrition facts. If the fruit is not in the list, it outputs nothing.







## Problem Set 3

### [Fuel Gauge](Problem%20set%203%20Exceptions/Fuel%20Gauge/fuel.py)

**Description:** This program prompts the user for a fraction, formatted as X/Y, and outputs the fuel level as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer. If 1% or less remains, it outputs "E" for empty. If 99% or more remains, it outputs "F" for full. It handles exceptions for invalid input.

**File:** `fuel.py`

In fuel.py, the program converts a fraction representing fuel level into a percentage and outputs either the percentage, "E" for empty, or "F" for full, handling any invalid input gracefully.

### [Felipe‚Äôs Taqueria](Problem%20set%203%20Exceptions/Felipe's%20Taqueria/taqueria.py)

**File:** `taqueria.py`

In taqueria.py, the program takes orders for items from Felipe's menu, calculates the total cost, and handles end-of-input exceptions, ensuring continuous order taking until the user finishes.

### [Grocery List](Problem%20set%203%20Exceptions/Grocery%20List/grocery.py)
